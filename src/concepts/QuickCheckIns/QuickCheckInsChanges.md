## QuickCheckIns Concept â€” Changes & Notes (Oct 17, 2025)

### What I examined
- `design/concepts/QuickCheckIns/implementation.md` (design/spec)
- `src/concepts/QuickCheckIns/QuickCheckInsSpecification.md` (formal spec)
- `src/concepts/QuickCheckIns/QuickCheckInsConcept.ts` (TypeScript implementation)

### Summary
The implementation closely follows the specification. The key state entities (`CheckIns` and `InternalMetrics`) and actions (`record`, `defineMetric`, `edit`) are implemented in `QuickCheckInsConcept.ts` and map to the spec's requirements and effects.

### Notable differences and decisions made in implementation
- Types: The implementation uses branded `ID` types for `User`, `ExternalMetricID`, and `CheckIn` (IDs) which strengthens type safety compared to plain strings in the spec.
- Date handling: The spec uses `DateTime`; implementation uses JavaScript `Date` for `at` fields.
- Return shapes: Implementation returns `{ checkIn: ID }` or `{ error: string }` for actions instead of throwing exceptions; this is a deliberate choice to make actions more explicit and test-friendly.
- Collection names: Implementation uses a prefix `QuickCheckIns.` for Mongo collection names to avoid collisions.

### Problems and edge cases found in implementation
- Metric existence: `record` and `edit` correctly verify that the referenced metric exists. Good.
- Id generation: Implementation uses `freshID()` for new IDs. Ensure `freshID` is deterministic-free and collision-safe in your environment.
- Partial updates: `edit` accepts optional `metric` and `value` and returns success if nothing to update; this matches spec but callers should be aware it is a no-op in that case.
- Error reporting: Implementation returns `{ error: string }` for failures. Consider throwing typed errors for clearer control flow in larger systems.

### Suggested small improvements
- Export `InternalMetricDocument` and `CheckInDocument` interfaces if other modules need to reference them.
- Add unit tests for negative paths: defining duplicate metric names, recording with undefined metric, editing someone else's check-in, and no-op edits.
- Consider normalizing dates to UTC at insert/read boundaries to avoid timezone drift in tests.

### Files changed / created
- `src/concepts/QuickCheckIns/QuickCheckInsChanges.md` (this file)

### Next steps
- Add tests under `src/concepts/QuickCheckIns` validating actions and edge cases.
- Optionally export types and add a README with examples.
