## QuickCheckIns Concept Changes (Oct 19, 2025)

### Interesting Moments
1. **Branded IDs across entities** — Adopted the shared `ID` branding for users, metrics, and check-ins to prevent string mix-ups. [Snapshot](../../../context/design/concepts/QuickCheckIns/implementation.md/steps/file.d8c1f2f1.md)
2. **Date handling tradeoffs** — Captured the decision to use native `Date` objects while noting the spec’s richer `DateTime` intent. [Snapshot](../../../context/design/concepts/QuickCheckIns/implementation.md/steps/file.d8c1f2f1.md)
3. **Structured return contracts** — Documented the choice to return `{ checkIn: ID }` or `{ error: string }` instead of throwing, optimizing for test ergonomics. [Snapshot](../../../context/design/concepts/QuickCheckIns/implementation.md/steps/file.d8c1f2f1.md)
4. **Namespacing Mongo collections** — Prefixed collections with `QuickCheckIns.` to avoid collisions in shared databases. [Snapshot](../../../context/design/concepts/QuickCheckIns/implementation.md/steps/file.d8c1f2f1.md)
5. **Guarding metric references** — Ensured `record` and `edit` validate metric existence before mutating state. [Snapshot](../../../context/design/concepts/QuickCheckIns/implementation.md/steps/file.d8c1f2f1.md)
6. **Negative-path coverage in tests** — Exercises duplicate metrics, unauthorized edits, and no-op updates to keep regressions in check. [Snapshot](../../../context/design/concepts/QuickCheckIns/testing.md/steps/file.e81b4071.md)

### Current State
- Core actions (`record`, `defineMetric`, `edit`) match the specification with branded IDs and collection namespacing.
- Response payloads are explicit and tests rely on structured success/error objects.
- Metric validation prevents orphaned check-ins, keeping data integrity intact.
