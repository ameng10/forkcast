## MealLog Concept & Test Changes (Oct 16, 2025)

### Specification Changes
- No major changes to the conceptual specification in `MealLogSpecification.md`. The concept still models meals with owner, time, items, notes, and status, and supports submit, edit, and delete actions with the same requirements and effects.

### Concept Implementation Changes (`MealLogConcept.ts`)
- **Type Fixes:** Updated `UserId` to use the branded `ID` type for stronger typing.
- **Export Fixes:** Ensured all necessary types and classes (`MealStatus`, `PermissionError`, `MealDocument`) are exported for use in tests.
- **MongoDB Connection:** Fixed how the MongoDB URI is passed to the concept, using the correct property from the client.
- **mealsCollection Initialization:** Marked `mealsCollection` with a definite assignment assertion (`!`) to satisfy TypeScript.

### Test Changes (`MealLogConcept.test.ts`)
- **Import Fixes:** Updated imports to use the correct bare specifiers and added missing dependencies to `deno.json`.
- **Type Mismatches:** Cast `mockUserResolver` to `(userId: string) => Promise<TestUser | undefined>` to match the conceptâ€™s constructor.
- **MongoDB URI Usage:** Replaced all instances of `db.client.s.url` with `client.options?.srvHost || "mongodb://localhost:27017"` for correct connection.
- **Async Assertion Fixes:** Replaced all `assertThrowsAsync` with `assertThrows` or `assertRejects` as appropriate.
- **Error Handling:** Added runtime checks for possibly undefined values (e.g., deleted meals).
- **Unused Variables:** Prefixed unused variables with `_` to satisfy TypeScript.

### Problems Encountered
- **Type Errors:** Type mismatches between branded `ID` and plain `string` for user IDs.
- **MongoDB Client Usage:** Incorrect property access (`db.client.s.url`) caused runtime and type errors.
- **Async Assertion:** Usage of `assertThrowsAsync` (which does not exist) instead of `assertThrows` or `assertRejects`.
- **Export Errors:** Missing exports for types used in tests.
- **Definite Assignment:** TypeScript required `mealsCollection` to be definitely assigned in the concept class.
- **Dependency Issues:** Inline imports (`jsr:`) required adding dependencies to `deno.json`.
