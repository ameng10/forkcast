## MealLog Concept Changes (Oct 19, 2025)

### Interesting Moments
1. **Branded user IDs adopted** — Tests now lean on the shared branded `ID` type for users and food items, reinforcing type safety across concepts. [Snapshot](../../../context/design/concepts/MealLog/testing.md/steps/file.8337e2c2.md)
2. **Export surface audit** — Verified that `MealStatus` and `PermissionError` are exported so the test harness can import them directly. [Snapshot](../../../context/design/concepts/MealLog/testing.md/steps/file.8337e2c2.md)
3. **Mongo connection handshake** — Captured the connect/disconnect lifecycle for establishing the MealLog collection against MongoDB. [Snapshot](../../../context/design/concepts/MealLog/implementation.md/steps/response.9f4979a0.md)
4. **Collection initialization discipline** — Documented the need to initialize `mealsCollection` inside `connect()` before any operations. [Snapshot](../../../context/design/concepts/MealLog/implementation.md/steps/response.9f4979a0.md)
5. **Async assertion modernization** — Highlighted the dependency on deprecated `assertThrowsAsync`, prompting the move to modern assertion helpers. [Snapshot](../../../context/design/concepts/MealLog/testing.md/steps/file.8337e2c2.md)
6. **Aligning Deno dependencies** — Noted the test imports from `jsr:@std/assert`, underscoring the dependency registration required in `deno.json`. [Snapshot](../../../context/design/concepts/MealLog/testing.md/steps/file.8337e2c2.md)

### Current State
- `MealLogConcept` now exposes the required types and uses branded IDs end-to-end.
- Mongo connections share a consistent URI negotiation strategy between implementation and tests.
- The test suite passes with updated async assertions and explicit dependencies.
