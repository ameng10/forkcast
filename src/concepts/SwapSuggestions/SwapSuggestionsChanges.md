# SwapSuggestions - Changes & Test Notes

This document records implementation details, test failures encountered, root causes, and the fixes or mitigations applied while getting the `SwapSuggestions` concept to a working state.

Summary
-------
- Implemented `SwapSuggestionsConcept` (in `src/concepts/SwapSuggestions/SwapSuggestionsConcept.ts`) matching the concept spec: `propose` and `accept` actions, and utility queries `_getProposal` and `_getProposalsByOwner`.
- Added robust error handling in `catch` blocks to handle `unknown` error types safely.
- Wrote tests in `src/SwapSuggestions/SwapSuggestionsConcept.test.ts` (provided) and iterated on failing assertions and resource leaks.

Files touched
------------
- src/SwapSuggestions/SwapSuggestionsConcept.ts (implementation)
- src/SwapSuggestions/SwapSuggestionsConcept.test.ts (tests provided)
- src/concepts/SwapSuggestions/SwapSuggestionsChanges.md (this file)

What I implemented
------------------
- Proposal document type mapped to MongoDB with fields: `_id`, `owner`, `risky` (Signal[]), `alternatives` (Alternative[]), `rationale`, `accepted`.
- `propose` action:
  - Creates a new `Proposal` document with a generated `_id` (from `freshID()`), sets `accepted` to `false`, and inserts it.
  - Returns `{}` on success or `{ error: string }` on failure.
  - `catch` now guards `e` with `e instanceof Error ? e.message : String(e)` to avoid TypeScript `unknown` errors.
- `accept` action:
  - Finds a matching proposal via exact array match on `owner`, `risky`, and `alternatives`.
  - Verifies `requester === proposal.owner` and `proposal.accepted === false` before updating.
  - Uses the same safe `catch` pattern to return readable error messages.
- Utility queries `_getProposal` and `_getProposalsByOwner` implemented to support testing.

Issues found during tests
-------------------------
1. TypeScript: `e` is `unknown` in `catch` blocks
   - Symptom: `Failed to create proposal: ${e.message}` produced compiler error `e is unknown`.
   - Fix: Narrow `e` with `e instanceof Error ? e.message : String(e)` before using `.message`.

2. Test failures related to `accept` behavior (two failing tests) and Deno resource leak warnings
   - Symptom: Two failing tests:
     - "Action: accept - requires matching proposal based on owner, risky, and alternatives"
     - "Action: accept - requires requester to be the owner"
     - Deno showed "Leaks detected" messages about TCP connections not being closed.
   - Analysis / Root causes:
     - Tests in the same file are not isolated from each other because the DB is dropped once per file (per the test harness) rather than per test case. Calls to `testDb()` return the same Mongo instance and tests append state across `Deno.test` blocks.
     - Because earlier tests create proposals (and sometimes accept them), later tests that expect "no matching proposal" or "not owner" conditions can accidentally find a matching or accepted proposal created earlierâ€”causing `accept` to succeed and the test's assertion that an error was returned to fail.
     - The "Leaks detected" messages are reported when async operations (network connections) are started but not fully cleaned up within test boundaries; they were triggered because tests relied on a shared DB lifecycle and the driver may keep sockets open briefly while the test runner checks for leaks.
   - Fixes / Mitigations applied or recommended:
     - Ensure per-test isolation: call `testDb()` inside each `Deno.test` (already done in the test file). If `testDb()` does not drop or isolate the DB per-call, update `testDb()` to call `db.dropDatabase()` before returning, or have it create a unique database name per test and return that isolated db instance.
     - For tests that rely on exact array equality, document that MongoDB array matching is order-sensitive. Either:
       - Update tests to pass arrays in the exact same order used at creation, or
       - Change the implementation to normalize arrays (sort) before storing and searching, or use a canonical key for matching (e.g., sorted joined string) to achieve `Set()` semantics.
     - Make sure `client.close()` is always called in a `finally` block (tests already do this). If `client.close()` isn't sufficient to avoid Deno leak warnings in the CI environment, consider a short delay after close or explicitly calling `db.client.close()`/driver-specific cleanup (but avoid reading private driver internals).

Design notes & deviations
-------------------------
- Array vs Set: The concept spec describes `risky` and `alternatives` as `Set(...)`. The current Mongo matching uses exact array equality (order + element equality). This difference is significant and should be reconciled:
  - Option A (recommended): Normalize arrays by sorting their elements before insert and before query. Use canonical ordering to preserve `Set` semantics.
  - Option B: Keep exact-array semantics but clearly document it in the specification and tests.

- Error shapes: Implementation returns `{ error: string }` instead of throwing. This matches existing code-style in other concepts, but be consistent across the codebase.

- ID generation: The implementation uses `freshID()` from `@utils/database.ts`. Ensure this function returns IDs compatible with other concepts and tests.

Next steps
----------
- If you want failing tests fixed automatically, I can:
  1. Update `testDb()` to drop the DB or create an isolated database per call (preferred) so each `Deno.test` is independent.
  2. Normalize `risky` and `alternatives` arrays on insert and on find to honor `Set()` semantics.
  3. Adjust tests to use canonical ordering for arrays or to assert ignoring order (e.g., compare sorted arrays or use `assertArrayIncludes` correctly).

- If you'd like, I can apply (1) and (2) now and run `deno test -A` to verify all tests in `src/SwapSuggestions` pass and to check for Deno leak warnings.
