# response:

I need to generate the API documentation for the `PersonalQA` concept based on the provided "API Specification (Canonical Endpoints)" and the structural rules.

However, the provided input **does not contain the full Concept Specification** for `PersonalQA` (or any other concept listed), specifically missing:

* The overall `purpose` of the concept.
* Detailed `requires` and `effects` for each action/query.
* Specific argument names, types, and result names/types for the actions and queries.
* A brief description for each action/query.

Therefore, I will generate the API documentation using placeholders for the missing information, explicitly noting where the detailed specification was not available in the provided text.

***
