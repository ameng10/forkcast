# response:

Please note: The provided prompt lists the endpoints for several concepts but **does not include the detailed concept specifications (purpose, specific action/query signatures with arguments/results, pre/post conditions)**. As such, the generated API documentation will follow the requested structure but will contain placeholders for the `Purpose`, `Description`, `Requirements`, `Effects`, and specific `Request Body` and `Success Response Body` schemas for each endpoint, as this information is not available in the input.
