# API Specification: InsightMining Concept

**Purpose:** Support the collection, analysis, and summarization of user observations to generate insights and reports.

***

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/InsightMining/ingest

**Description:** Ingests a new observation from a user for later analysis.

**Requirements:**

* The `owner` (User ID) must correspond to an existing user.
* The `observation` string must not be empty.

**Effects:**

* A new observation is stored and associated with the `owner`.
* A unique identifier (`observationId`) for the new observation is generated and returned.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "owner": "ID",
  "observation": "String"
}
```

**Success Response Body (Action):**

```json
{
  "observationId": "ID"
}
```

**Error Response Body:**

```json
{
  "error": "string"
}
```

***

### POST /api/InsightMining/analyze

**Description:** Processes a user's observations to generate new insights.

**Requirements:**

* The `owner` (User ID) must correspond to an existing user.
* There must be at least one observation associated with the `owner`.

**Effects:**

* The system analyzes the `owner`'s observations.
* New insights, if generated, are stored and associated with the `owner`.
* Returns a list of unique identifiers (`insightIds`) for any newly generated insights.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "owner": "ID"
}
```

**Success Response Body (Action):**

```json
{
  "insightIds": ["ID"]
}
```

**Error Response Body:**

```json
{
  "error": "string"
}
```

***

### POST /api/InsightMining/summarize

**Description:** Generates a summary report based on a user's observations and insights.

**Requirements:**

* The `owner` (User ID) must correspond to an existing user.
* There must be at least one observation or insight associated with the `owner`.

**Effects:**

* A summary `report` string is generated based on the `owner`'s observations and insights.
* The generated `report` string is returned.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "owner": "ID"
}
```

**Success Response Body (Action):**

```json
{
  "report": "String"
}
```

**Error Response Body:**

```json
{
  "error": "string"
}
```

***

### POST /api/InsightMining/deactivate

**Description:** Deactivates the insight mining process for a user, potentially archiving or stopping further analysis.

**Requirements:**

* The `owner` (User ID) must correspond to an existing user.
* The user's insight mining status must be active.

**Effects:**

* The insight mining functionality for the `owner` is deactivated.
* This might prevent future `ingest`, `analyze`, or `summarize` actions until reactivated.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "owner": "ID"
}
```

**Success Response Body (Action):**

```json
{}
```

**Error Response Body:**

```json
{
  "error": "string"
}
```

***

### POST /api/InsightMining/\_getObservationsForUser

**Description:** Retrieves all observations previously ingested by a specific user.

**Requirements:**

* The `owner` (User ID) must correspond to an existing user.

**Effects:**

* Returns a list of all observations associated with the `owner`, each with its unique identifier and content.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "owner": "ID"
}
```

**Success Response Body (Query):**

```json
[
  {
    "observationId": "ID",
    "observation": "String"
  }
]
```

**Error Response Body:**

```json
{
  "error": "string"
}
```

***

### POST /api/InsightMining/\_getInsightsForUser

**Description:** Retrieves all insights generated for a specific user.

  }
]
```

**Error Response Body:**

  "error": "string"
}
```

***
