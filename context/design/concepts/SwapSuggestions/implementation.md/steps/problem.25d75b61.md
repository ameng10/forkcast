# problem:

The TypeScript compiler reports the following error:
`'e' is of type 'unknown'.deno-ts(18046)`

This occurs because, in TypeScript's `catch` blocks, the caught error variable `e` is typed as `unknown` by default. This is a safety measure to prevent accessing properties on an error object that might not exist (e.g., if a non-`Error` object is thrown). To access properties like `.message`, TypeScript requires `e` to be narrowed to a more specific type.
