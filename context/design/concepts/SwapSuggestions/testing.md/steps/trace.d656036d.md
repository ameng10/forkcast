# trace:

The trace demonstrates how the `principle` of the `SwapSuggestions` concept is fulfilled by a sequence of actions.

1. **Given**: An author `authorA` and a requester `requesterA` (who is the same as `authorA`), along with defined `Signal` and `Alternative` identifiers.

2. **Action**: The system, or `authorA` via a synchronization (not explicitly shown here, but assumed as per `concept: {name}` description), `propose`s a new swap suggestion because a high CPU usage signal indicates risk.
   ```typescript
   concept.propose({
     owner: "user:Alice" as ID,
     risky: ["signal:HighCpuUsage" as ID],
     alternatives: ["alternative:OptimizeApplicationCode" as ID, "alternative:UpgradeSubscriptionPlan" as ID],
     rationale: "High CPU usage detected, suggesting code optimization or plan upgrade.",
   });
   ```

3. **Result**: A new `Proposal` document is added to the `proposals` collection in the `SwapSuggestions` concept's state. The `_id` of the new proposal is generated, and its `accepted` flag is set to `false` by default.
   ```json
   // State after propose:
   {
     "_id": "proposal:xyz",
     "owner": "user:Alice",
     "risky": ["signal:HighCpuUsage"],
     "alternatives": ["alternative:OptimizeApplicationCode", "alternative:UpgradeSubscriptionPlan"],
     "rationale": "High CPU usage detected, suggesting code optimization or plan upgrade.",
     "accepted": false
   }
   ```

4. **Verification**: The `SwapSuggestionsConcept._getProposalsByOwner` query can be used to retrieve the newly created proposal for `authorA`.
   ```typescript
   concept._getProposalsByOwner({ owner: "user:Alice" as ID });
   ```
   The query confirms that the proposal exists, its owner, risky signals, alternatives, rationale, and that `accepted` is `false`.

5. **Action**: `requesterA` (who is also `authorA`) decides to `accept` their own proposal. The action includes the original `owner`, `risky` signals, and `alternatives` to identify the specific proposal.
   ```typescript
   concept.accept({
     requester: "user:Alice" as ID,
     owner: "user:Alice" as ID,
     risky: ["signal:HighCpuUsage" as ID],
     alternatives: ["alternative:OptimizeApplicationCode" as ID, "alternative:UpgradeSubscriptionPlan" as ID],
   });
   ```

6. **Precondition Check**:
   * The concept first checks if a `Proposal` exists matching the `owner`, `risky`, and `alternatives` provided. It finds `proposal:xyz`.
   * It then checks if `requester` (`user:Alice`) is equal to the `owner` of the found proposal (`user:Alice`). This is true.
   * It checks if the proposal is already `accepted`. It is `false`, so this condition passes.

7. **Result**: All `requires` conditions are met. The `effects` of the `accept` action are executed. The `accepted` flag of `proposal:xyz` is updated to `true` in the `proposals` collection.
   ```json
   // State after accept:
   {
     "_id": "proposal:xyz",
     "owner": "user:Alice",
     "risky": ["signal:HighCpuUsage"],
     "alternatives": ["alternative:OptimizeApplicationCode", "alternative:UpgradeSubscriptionPlan"],
     "rationale": "High CPU usage detected, suggesting code optimization or plan upgrade.",
     "accepted": true
   }
   ```

8. **Final Verification**: The `SwapSuggestionsConcept._getProposal` query (or `_getProposalsByOwner` again) can be used to retrieve the updated proposal.
   ```typescript
   concept._getProposal({ proposalId: "proposal:xyz" as ID });
   ```
   The query confirms that the proposal `accepted` flag is now `true`, fulfilling the principle that the user can accept a proposed safer alternative.
