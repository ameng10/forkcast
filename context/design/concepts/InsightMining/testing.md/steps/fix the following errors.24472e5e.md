# fix the following errors:

Conversion of type '{ report: ReportDoc; } | { error: string; }' to type '{ report: ID; }' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
Property 'report' is missing in type '{ error: string; }' but required in type '{ report: ID; }'.deno-ts(2352)
InsightMiningConcept.test.ts(204, 49): 'report' is declared here.

Property '\_id' does not exist on type 'ID'.deno-ts(2339)
