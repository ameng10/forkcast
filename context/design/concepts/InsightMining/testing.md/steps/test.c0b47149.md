# test: InsightMining

Use the following concept and tests to understand why I fail the following test cases. Do not include tests that require specific LLM output because the LLM output will be different every time. Include tests that makes sure that actions work and queries work. First fix the \_getInsightsForUser query, then fix the cases where signals aren't helpful or harmful. If the signal's aren't helpful or harmful, then there should be an empty response in the helpful and harmful areas:
Principle: System ingests, analyzes, and summarizes observations ...
Phase 1: Ingest observations ... ok (236ms)
Phase 2: Analyze observations ... ok (172ms)
Phase 3: Summarize observations and insights into a report ... ok (86ms)
Principle: System ingests, analyzes, and summarizes observations ... ok (1s)
Action: ingest - Adds observation correctly and handles empty signals ...
Ingest with signals ... ok (53ms)
Ingest with empty signals ... ok (38ms)
Action: ingest - Adds observation correctly and handles empty signals ... ok (613ms)
Action: analyze - Requires observations in window and calculates correctly ...
Requires: No observations in window ... ok (70ms)
Effects: Correctly computes and upserts insights with multiple observations ... ok (260ms)
Effects: Handles observations with no signals array correctly ... ok (95ms)
Action: analyze - Requires observations in window and calculates correctly ... ok (1s)
Action: summarize - Requirements and effects on report content ...
Requires: No observations in period ... ok (87ms)
Requires: Unsupported period string ... ok (32ms)
Effects: Generates report with topHelpful/topHarmful and metricTrends ... ok (288ms)
Effects: Handles cases where no signals are helpful/harmful ... FAILED (192ms)
Action: summarize - Requirements and effects on report content ... FAILED (due to 1 failed step) (1s)
Action: deactivate - Requires insight to exist and correct requester ...
Setup: Ingest and analyze to create an insight ... ok (103ms)
Requires: Unauthorized requester ... ok (0ms)
Requires: Non-existent insight ... ok (19ms)
Action: deactivate - Requires insight to exist and correct requester ... ok (779ms)
Action: deactivate - Successfully deactivates insight and handles re-deactivation ...
Setup: Create an active insight ... ok (123ms)
Effects: Successfully deactivates an insight ... ok (85ms)
Edge Case: Attempt to deactivate an already inactive insight ... ok (22ms)
Action: deactivate - Successfully deactivates insight and handles re-deactivation ... ok (792ms)
Queries: Retrieval functions work correctly ...
\_getObservationsForUser ... ok (107ms)
\_getInsightsForUser ... FAILED (198ms)
\_getReport ... ok (219ms)
Queries: Retrieval functions work correctly ... FAILED (due to 1 failed step) (1s)
