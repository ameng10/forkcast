# response:

Here's the corrected `InsightMiningConcept.ts` implementation and the updated `InsightMiningConcept.test.ts` test suite.

The main issue was a mismatch between the concept's `summarize` action specification (which implies returning the `ID` of the report) and the TypeScript implementation (which returned the full `ReportDoc`). The test file then incorrectly tried to access `_id` on an `ID` type.

The fix involves:

1. **Modifying `src/InsightMining/InsightMiningConcept.ts`**: The `summarize` action's return type and the actual value returned are updated to return `ID` as specified.
2. **Modifying `src/InsightMining/InsightMiningConcept.test.ts`**: The test code is adjusted to correctly handle `reportId` (which is now directly an `ID`) when retrieving the report. An additional small correction was made in the `_getReport` query test to properly call `summarize`.
