# test: InsightMining

Use the following concept and tests to understand why I fail the following test cases. Then fix the implementation or the tests:
running 7 tests from ./src/concepts/InsightMining/InsightMiningConcept.test.ts
Principle: System ingests, analyzes, and summarizes observations ...
Phase 1: Ingest observations ... ok (230ms)
Phase 2: Analyze observations ... FAILED (197ms)
Phase 3: Summarize observations and insights into a report ... ok (83ms)
Principle: System ingests, analyzes, and summarizes observations ... FAILED (due to 1 failed step) (1s)
Action: ingest - Adds observation correctly and handles empty signals ...
Ingest with signals ... ok (50ms)
Ingest with empty signals ... ok (37ms)
Action: ingest - Adds observation correctly and handles empty signals ... ok (622ms)
Action: analyze - Requires observations in window and calculates correctly ...
Requires: No observations in window ... ok (67ms)
Effects: Correctly computes and upserts insights with multiple observations ... ok (259ms)
Effects: Handles observations with no signals array correctly ... ok (132ms)
Action: analyze - Requires observations in window and calculates correctly ... ok (929ms)
Action: summarize - Requirements and effects on report content ...
Requires: No observations in period ... ok (19ms)
Requires: Unsupported period string ... ok (37ms)
Effects: Generates report with topHelpful/topHarmful and metricTrends ... ok (281ms)
Effects: Handles cases where no signals are helpful/harmful ... FAILED (233ms)
Action: summarize - Requirements and effects on report content ... FAILED (due to 1 failed step) (1s)
Action: deactivate - Requires insight to exist and correct requester ...
Setup: Ingest and analyze to create an insight ... ok (107ms)
Requires: Unauthorized requester ... ok (0ms)
Requires: Non-existent insight ... ok (18ms)
Action: deactivate - Requires insight to exist and correct requester ... ok (728ms)
Action: deactivate - Successfully deactivates insight and handles re-deactivation ...
Setup: Create an active insight ... ok (100ms)
Effects: Successfully deactivates an insight ... ok (68ms)
Edge Case: Attempt to deactivate an already inactive insight ... ok (18ms)
Action: deactivate - Successfully deactivates insight and handles re-deactivation ... ok (612ms)
Queries: Retrieval functions work correctly ...
\_getObservationsForUser ... ok (105ms)
\_getInsightsForUser ... FAILED (177ms)
\_getReport ... ok (183ms)
Queries: Retrieval functions work correctly ... FAILED (due to 1 failed step) (984ms)
