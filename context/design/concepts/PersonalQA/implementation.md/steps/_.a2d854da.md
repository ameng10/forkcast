# PersonalQA Concept Specification

## Concept: PersonalQA \[User, Fact, Question, Answer, Time]

**purpose**
Answer a user’s food questions using their own meals, check-ins, and insights.

**principle**
The assistant maintains a private fact base of normalized statements (from meals, check-ins, insights, behavior changes) and answers questions by citing those facts.

**state**

```
a set of Facts with
  an owner User
  an at DateTime
  a content String
  a source of "meal" or "check_in" or "insight" or "behavior"

a set of QAs with
  an owner User
  a question String
  an answer String
  a citedFacts set of Fact
```

**actions**

* `ingestFact(owner: User, at: Time, content: Fact, source: String)`
  * **effects:** add a fact to the owner's fact base.
* `forgetFact(requester: User, factId: string)`
  * **requires:** the fact identified by `factId` exists and belongs to `requester`.
  * **effects:** remove the specified fact.
* `ask(requester: User, question: Question): Promise<{ answer: Answer, citedFacts: Fact[] }>`
  * **requires:** `requester` exists.
  * **effects:** produce an `answer` derived from `requester`’s `Facts`; store the `QA` with `owner = requester`; return `answer` with `citedFacts`.
    * *Note: The answer derivation logic is simplified for this implementation, focusing on the concept design rather than advanced AI/NLP.*
