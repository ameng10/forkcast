# implement: Change the PersonalQAImplementation so that the behavior is the same but the code follows the correct specifications and design standard. Make sure the behavior of the code is not changed. The code should work so that the sync engine works. Make sure the input format is like the following:

async createSurvey(
{ author, title, scaleMin, scaleMax }: {
author: Author;
title: string;
scaleMin: number;
scaleMax: number;
},
).
