# test: QuickCheckIns

Use the context to create tests similar to the tests in LikertSurvey testing. It should be in typescript. I want many tests with all the tests being modular and testing different aspects. There should also be edge cases. Try to make my implementation fail. The tests should cover similar cases as MealLogConsoleOutput.
