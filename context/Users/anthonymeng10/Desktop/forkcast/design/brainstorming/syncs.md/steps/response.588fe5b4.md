# response:

Here are the synchronization implementations for the concepts that are not designated as public passthrough routes. These syncs handle the request/response cycle, including authorization by verifying a user's session.

All synchronizations are placed in a single file for convenience, but they could be split into multiple files under `src/syncs/` as described in the documentation.
