# implement: Create the meallog syncronizations using the concepts above. The only included/public actions are the following:

"/api/UserAuthentication/register": "public endpoint to create account",
"/api/UserAuthentication/login": "public endpoint to start session",

There should be a sync where a submit of a meal should also get the meals of the user to show.
